    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a brief summary of who I am. Born and raised in Mexico,
      I immigrated to the United States in my early twenties. With a background
      in design, I developed an interest in web development, since
      it allows me to pursue both of my passions: design and technology.
      I am now attending Wyncode Academy web immersive bootcamp, with the intention
      to further develop my coding skills.
      I have adopted Marie Forleo's motto "Everything is figure-out-able" as my own life mantra.
      Besides computers, my interests include photography, cooking and traveling.
      Currently, I reside in Miami Beach, FL.
